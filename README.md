# crstancel.github.io
website
1.	Christopher Stancel (crstancel1@my.waketech.edu)
2.	My github account is a brief personal portfolio about myself, my interests, and how to contact me.
3.	The repository features all of the website information, images, and files to run the page successfully
4.	I had to change the initial html code on every file to ensure they functioned properly. Adding images and files names. Edited all text to make sure everything was lowercase. Uploaded files. Copied changes to existing main branch
